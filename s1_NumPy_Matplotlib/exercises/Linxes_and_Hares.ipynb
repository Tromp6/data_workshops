    "### First \n",
    "* Load the file populations.txt as data\n",
    "* Define 4 arrays called : year, hares, lynxes, carrots. In order to have the columns as variables, take the transpose of data. Then, load (contain in data) the associated values in the 4 corresponding arrays.\n",
    "* Plot the corresponding number of hares, lynxes and carrots as a function of the year\n",
    "* -- Precise the axes (0.2,0.1,0.5,0.8)\n",
    "* -- Plot a legend at the location (1.05,0.5)\n",

    "* Which species has the largest population for each year? (Hint : argsort & fancy indexing of np.array(['H', 'L', 'C']))\n",
    "* Which years any of the populations is above 50000? (Hint: comparisons and np.any)\n",
